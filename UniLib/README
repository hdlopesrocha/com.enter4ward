Hello dear programmer if you like Java and C# and also like to be fast, use this powerful library.
We have cookies and some abstract type of Collections, a great Math library like XNA and some utilities for OpenGL.
We also will have some hack tools and network abstractions.

We hope you like our work :-)

Thank you.
